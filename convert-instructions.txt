Alright these are the steps we will follow
1. I will identify the supabase component I need us to work on
2. We will identify and list all shadcn components used as building blocks for the indentified supabase ui
3. I will install the vue component equivalents of the listed Next components (pure shadcn is Next)
4. I will provide you with the Next version of the supabase UI and you will configure it to use vue syntax and all that
5. I will check and povide feedback after testing
**RULES GUIDING THIS MOVEMENT**
Always prompt me to provide the code for the installed components (DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CREATE THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOWNLOADED FROM SHADCN-VUE). This is to prevent conflicts with the latest component versions
Remember that most composables by default are already done by supabase-nuxt. So any new composable you're about to make, tell me the reason why.
Understood?
