# Supabase UI for Nuxt 4 by Quanta-69

## Setup
Make sure to install dependencies (npm install)

Get your Nuxt .env variables and create your .env file.


## Description
This template is the Vue version of the Supabase UI which was made with shadcn (next) and supabase.

Recreated using shadcn-vue and supabase-js.


## The Components Folder
==> Houses ALL UI components. Divided into ui and supabase
---> /components/ui for housing shadcn-vue components (untouched)
---> /components/supabase housing supabase components (built using the components from /ui)

## The Composables Folder
==> Houses ALL reusable logic. **Documentation for each composable coming soon!**

## The Middleware Folder
==> Houses different middleware logic (only 1 for now).
**NOTE THAT CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE NUXT.CONFIG.TS FILE. MAKE SURE TO VISIT THAT FILE**

## Strengths
==> Can handle complete authentication (including email OTP)
==> More components coming soon!

                                            **ENJOY!**
